# About repository
This repository houses the "Museum Guard" game, developed in Unity, which counted as a deliverable for exam eligibility in the course "Game Design". As the "Game Design" course focuses on the designing aspect of games, and not on the product of said design, this game is simply a prototype to implement and test design choices. Much of the game and its designed functionality and assets are missing, and the prototype should therefore be considered more of a "proof of concept".

## Game description
The game is a single player action game that focuses on exaggerated interactions with museum guests. The player plays as the museum guard and is tasked with keeping the museum quiet and functioning. In the play-loop, the player gets to mitigate increasingly exaggerated situations, and is presented with tools to mitigate them. In addition to the main play-loop, the player is tasked with keeping the guard happy, such that his work does not influence his family-life. As a reward, the player is presented with cutscenes that reflect the guard's happiness, which can be either good or bad.

## Current state of the game
The game so far, has only a subset of the designet elements for the game. As an example, the game loop is fixed to only be walking around and shushing on guests without any day-cycle. In other words, it only shows one element of the core functionality, which is shushing on loud guests. Here's a list of elements that has been designed for implementation and whether is has been implementd:

1. day cycle
    - [ ] End of day
    - [ ] Cutscenes
    - [ ] Good / bad cutscenes
2. Powers
    - [ ] Flashlight stuns guests
    - [x] Hushing guests makes them quiet
    - [ ] Rustling keychain locks people who steal up
3. NPCs
    - [ ] Stealing NPCs
    - [x] Loud NPCs
    - [x] Pathfinding
4. Tutorial
    - [ ] A tutorial stage
    - [ ] Present abilities to user
    - [ ] Present interactions with environment and guests
5. Home
    - [ ] A lobby in between days
    - [ ] Decorations for increase in abilities and happiness
    - [ ] A shop
6. Museum
    - [ ] Procedually generated layout
    - [x] Attractions
    - [ ] Souvineer shop
  
# Conclusion
This game is not finished, and will not be finished. Considering the small time frame, of which this prototype was to be build, a lot of the core functionality has been implemented. From another perspective, as a prototype for the exploration of "Game Design", this repository has served its purpose in presenting a desired deliverable.
